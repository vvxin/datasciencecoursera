This application is to explore the relationship between ozone concentration and weather conditions, and try to predict ozone level with different model configuration.

### Menu description

1. **Data:**  The page shows the _airquality_ (an base R dataset) data by a sortable table.
2. **Plot:**  The page generates scatterplot of Ozone and a weather parameter you choose, with option to show linear fitted line.
3. **Model:** At this tab, you could train a linear regression or random forest model with different weather parameters, and see how it works with the correlation coefficient of test dataset and predicted result. Model only runs each time you click the "Run the model" button.
4. **About:** This page, as the document of application required for the assignment.
